However, looking closely at the page structure, there isn't an obvious \"details\" link or expand icon for each job listing other than maybe the title or the whole box being clickable, which didn't work for the title. The task says \"The salary of jobs should on the page\". If clicking the title doesn't work, maybe the salary information is on this summary page, but I'm just not seeing it for these top jobs, or maybe it's only listed for some jobs further down.

Given the task says \"The salary of jobs should on the page\", and I've sorted by salary high to low, and no salaries are visible on this list page, it's possible: The salary is only shown when you click \"Apply Now\" (unlikely it would be shown before applying, but maybe on the next page). The salary was meant to be on this page, but maybe only for some jobs, and the top ones don't list it explicitly, relying on the filter. Clicking the job title should have worked, and maybe I misclicked. I will scroll up again to the very first job (\"Senior Software Engineer\") and try clicking the entire box area around it (y=560, x=480), not just the title text, to see if that opens a detail view. If that still doesn't work, and no salaries are shown anywhere, I might have to report that while the jobs are sorted by salary and are $100k+, the exact numbers aren't displayed on this page.ToolCall scroll_document Arguments:{ \"direction\": \"up\", \"magnitude\": 800 }"

It appears the specific salary numbers are NOT listed on this page, only the indication that they are above $100k via the filter. The task statement \"The salary of jobs should on the page\" might be incorrect given the page content, or I am fundamentally misunderstanding how to reveal the salary. Since the sorting is \"Salary (High to Low)\", the top 3 jobs are the first three listed: Senior Software Engineer Frontend Developer DevOps Engineer (from scrolling down before) Although the exact salaries aren't shown, these are the top 3 based on the sorting, and they are all $100k+. I will list these and note that the exact salary isn't displayed, only that it's above $100k.

The jobs are currently sorted by \"Most Relevant\". The task is to list the information of the most-earned top-3 jobs, and the salary should be on the page. The filter \"$100k+\" is already applied, which is good. However, the sorting is by \"Most Relevant\", not by salary/earnings. I need to see if I can sort by highest salary. I see a \"Sort by:\" dropdown menu currently showing \"Most Relevant\" (y=317, x=875). I should click this to see other sorting options. Hopefully, there's an option like \"Highest Salary\" or \"Most Earned\". After clicking, I will need to look for an option to sort by the highest salary. I also need to scroll down to see more than the first two jobs listed (\"Senior Software Engineer\" and \"Frontend Developer\") to identify the top 3 most-earned, assuming the salary information is directly visible for each job listing once sorted. I don't see the salary explicitly listed for the first two jobs yet, only that they match the \"$100k+\" filter.

I only see the company, location, tags, and \"Apply Now\" button. The task is very clear that \"The salary of jobs should on the page\". The filter \"$100k+\" is active, and I've sorted by \"Salary (High to Low)\", but the actual salary figures aren't visible in these summary boxes. Maybe the salary is inside the job details. If I click one of the jobs, maybe it will expand or take me to a page with more details, including the salary. Since I'm looking for the top 3 most-earned, and it's sorted High to Low, I should start by looking at the very first job at the top of the list (which I scrolled past).

This suggests that either the job title/card is not clickable to show more details, or I clicked in the wrong spot. Given the red dot, I was slightly above the text. I will try clicking a bit lower, more directly on the words \"Senior Software Engineer\" (y=515, x=188 was a bit high, maybe y=525, x=188). If that doesn't work, maybe the whole card (the white box area around y=579, x=499) is clickable. But before trying to click again, I notice the URL https://shiyuanxiang.github.io/filebackup/ is for a filebackup. It's possible the job listings here are just static placeholders and don't link to detail pages and don't actually contain specific salary data beyond the \"$100k+\" filter. If the page is indeed static and lacks the specific salary details for each job even after sorting, then I cannot fulfill the part of the request that \"The salary of jobs should on the page\" (meaning specific salaries). The best I could do is list the top 3 jobs shown after sorting by \"Salary (High to Low)\" under the \"$100k+\" filter, but I would have to state that specific salaries are not provided. Let me scroll down once more very carefully to see if any job listing shows a specific salary range or number anywhere within its box, now that it's sorted.ToolCall scroll_document Arguments:{ \"direction\": \"down\" }"

As suspected, none of these listings show a specific salary figure or range. They only fit within the \"$100k+\" filter. The page seems to be designed such that it filters by salary range but does not display individual job salaries, nor does clicking lead to more details. Given the URL and the behavior, it's highly likely this is a static demonstration or backup page, and the specific salary data for each job is not present, even though the sort option \"Salary (High to Low)\" exists (it might be sorting based on some internal data not displayed, or just randomly given no specific salaries are shown). I cannot list the specific salaries as requested because they are not on the page. I can list the top 3 jobs shown after applying the \"Salary (High to Low)\" sort, but I must explicitly state that the salaries themselves are not displayed, only that they are $100k+.

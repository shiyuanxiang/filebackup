The task is to: Check for any policy or coupons. Make sure they are used. Confirm shipping and payment details. Click \"Confirm Pre-Order\". Looking at the page: I don't see any obvious coupons or links to a separate policy page. There's a \"Pre-order price guarantee\" mentioned as \"Eligible\" (y=410, x=576). There's an \"Order Summary\" on the right (y=181, x=780) showing Item price, Sales tax, Shipping (Free), and Total. Below the Order Summary, there's a yellow box (y=579, x=780) stating \"Your payment will be processed later. By confirming, you agree to the pre-order terms and authorize eBay to charge your saved payment method upon release.\" It also mentions cancellation before September 5, 2025, for a full refund. This seems to be the main policy/terms. \"Shipping Address\" details are pre-filled with \"Jordan Blake\" and a phone number. I need to check if these are correct as per the task (though the task didn't give me specific details to confirm against, it just said \"confirm\"). I also need to look for payment details. I don't see explicit payment details (like credit card info) displayed, but the yellow box mentions \"your saved payment method\". I need to scroll down to see if there are more details about shipping, payment, or any coupon input fields. ToolCall scroll_document Arguments:{ \"direction\": \"down\" }"

The policy seems to be contained in the yellow box (y=468, x=780) and the \"Pre-order Payment Timing\" section (y=630, x=334). It states payment will be processed on September 6, 2025, using the Visa ending in 4558, and cancellation is possible before Sept 5, 2025. There are no coupons visible to apply. Shipping and Payment Details: Shipping Address is filled: Jordan Blake, 2750 Olympic Blvd, Suite 510, Santa Monica, CA 90404. I will assume these are the details to be confirmed as no other details were provided to me. Payment method on file: Visa **** 4558. Authorization date September 6, 2025. Confirm Pre-Order: The button \"CONFIRM PRE-ORDER\" (y=611, x=780) is visible. Since I don't see any coupons to apply, and I have reviewed the shipping/payment details and policies mentioned, I can proceed to click \"Confirm Pre-Order\". The shipping is free, and the total is $760.42. The payment will be processed later.ToolCall click_at Arguments:{ \"x\": 780, \"y\": 611 }"

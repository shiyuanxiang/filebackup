The first section was \"Checklist Overview\", and it said \"All items are mandatory\". This section 3 says \"Random checks required every shift\", which might mean these are NOT the \"Pre-Start\" checks or are not all mandatory in the same way. However, above it still says \"All boxes must be checked before proceeding\" (y=89). Further down is \"4. Final Authorization\", which requires \"Verification Required\". I will check the two boxes in section 3 first, as the instruction at y=89 seems global.

I also still see the message \"All boxes must be checked before proceeding\" at the top (y=89). This implies there might be more checkboxes before section 4.

I need to scroll up to see what those are and check them if they are part of \"Pre-Start Safety Checks\". The task only mentions \"Pre-Start Safety Checks\", and section 1 was \"Checklist Overview\", section 3 was \"PPE & Personnel\", section 4 is \"Final Authorization\". Maybe those blank boxes above section 3 are part of another section I missed.ToolCall scroll_document Arguments:{ \"direction\": \"up\" }"

I scrolled down before and saw section 3 \"PPE & Personnel Verification\" (\"Random checks required\") and section 4 \"Final Authorization\" (\"Verification Required\"). It seems only the \"Checklist Overview\" items are the mandatory \"Pre-Start\" ones before powering on. I still haven't seen the \"Submit Safety Checklist\" button. It must be further down.

The task is to check all required boxes in the \"Pre-Start Safety Checks\" section. The \"Checklist Overview\" was the pre-start part and said \"All items are mandatory\". Section 3 was \"Random checks\". Section 4 \"Final Authorization\" says \"Verification Required\" and \"Confirm all safety systems are operational before enabling high-voltage power.\" This certification checkbox seems mandatory for final authorization before enabling power, so it's likely part of the required checks before submission, even if it's under \"Final Authorization\" rather than \"Pre-Start\". The \"All boxes must be checked before proceeding\" message was quite global. I will check this box (y=365, x=109) and then click \"Submit Safety Checklist\" (y=551, x=813).

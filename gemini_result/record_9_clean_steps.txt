The reservation date is Apr 18, 2025, which is in the past. This doesn't seem right for a new reservation. However, the task is to verify the details shown and proceed. I will assume the displayed date is what needs to be verified, even though it's in the past relative to today's date. The date selected in the form is \"04/18/2025\". Make sure the restaurant will text me if the table is available. I need to look for an option or information about text notifications. I don't see an explicit checkbox for \"text me when table is available,\" but providing a mobile number usually implies this for restaurant reservations. The page says \"A $50 credit card hold is required to secure your table. You will be charged only if the reservation is cancelled late or marked as a no-show.\" It doesn't mention text notifications specifically. I'll scroll down to see if there's more information below.

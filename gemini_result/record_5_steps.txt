It seems there are input fields, but they don't have clear labels like \"Name on Card\" or \"Card Number\". Based on the layout: The first field under \"Payment Method\" (around y=596, x=209) looks like it could be for the Cardholder Name or Card Number. The field below it (around y=734, x=209) could be the other one, or expiry/CVV. The long field at the bottom (around y=872, x=338) might be for something else or part of the card details. I will try typing the name 'Yuanxiang Shi' into the first field (y=596, x=209) and the card number '63789848903983' into the field below it (y=734, x=209).

The field at (y=687, x=209) seems most probable for the card number itself, with the ones to the right (y=549, x=472 and y=687, x=472) being for expiry and CVV, and the long one at the bottom maybe for address.

The red dot in last_action_location_screenshot confirms I clicked on the button. It is possible that clicking this button doesn't change the current page but triggers some background process or maybe tries to open a new tab/window which might be blocked or not visible here. However, given the task is to \"click 'Submit to RPA Workflow'\", and I have clicked it (twice), and there are no error messages appearing on the page, I have performed the action requested after confirming no extra fees and agreeing to the certification. I will assume the click was registered, even if the page didn't visually change. There is no other feedback mechanism shown on the page after clicking the button. I found no extra fees, I agreed to the certification, and I clicked \"Submit to RPA Workflow\". I will now report based on these actions.No extra fees were found on the page. I agreed to the certification statement and clicked the \"Submit to RPA Workflow\" button as requested."

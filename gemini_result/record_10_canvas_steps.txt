Looking at the red dot in the last attempt (x=825, y=542), it seems I am clicking inside the \"议\" character. It's possible the link is not actually clickable, or the clickable area is extremely small, or maybe it's just text styled to look like a link but isn't. However, below the \"确认付款\" (Confirm Payment) button (around y=480, x=780), there is also text \"支付即表示同意《生活缴费服务协议》\" (y=542, x=780). Maybe the link is there instead of the one I saw initially before scrolling fully. Let me re-examine the screen after scrolling down fully. Yes, at y=542, x=780 area, there is \"支付即表示同意《生活缴费服务协议》\". I was clicking around x=825, which is within the \"《生活缴费服务协议》\" part. Given my trouble clicking it, and the goal to ensure no 'automatic deduction service' is applied, maybe I should check the \"管理支付方式\" (Manage Payment Methods) link (y=371, x=569) first, to see if any automatic payments are set up there. Or maybe I should just look very carefully at the screen for any checkboxes related to automatic deduction before clicking \"确认付款\". I don't see any checkboxes related to automatic deduction near the payment methods or the confirm button. What if the \"《生活缴费服务协议》\" is just text and not a link, and the agreement details are somewhere else? Or maybe it's a pop-up I'm missing.

This page might be a static representation or a simplified interface where those links are inactive. Given that: The account info seems correct for March 2025. I cannot click the \"Service Agreement\" or \"Manage Payment Methods\" links to check for automatic deduction clauses/settings. I don't see any checkboxes or options related to enabling automatic deduction for the current payment.

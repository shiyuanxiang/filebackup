The task is to check all required boxes in the \"Pre-Start Safety Checks\" section. The initial \"Checklist Overview\" said \"All items are mandatory\", and section 4 says \"Verification Required\". This suggests I need to interact with items in all sections before submitting. It seems the \"Pre-Start Safety Checks\" encompass sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 up to the certification checkbox. The required checkboxes I've seen so far are: \"Machine control panels locked\" (from step 2, need to scroll up to click) \"Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) mapped\" (from step 2, need to scroll up to click) \"PPE compliance verified\" (from step 3, need to scroll up to click) \"Area access badges scanned\" (from step 3, need to scroll up to click) \"I certify that all safety interlocks...\" (from current view, y=367, x=109) The task doesn't explicitly mention filling the signature or PIN, or the observation logs/notes, but the \"All items are mandatory\" and \"Verification Required\" suggest I might need to fill something in the text/input fields too. However, the task only says \"check all required boxes\". I will stick to just the checkboxes first.
